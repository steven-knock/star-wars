In the spirit of remaking vintage arcade games, this is my version of the trench sequence
(3rd level) of Star Wars. I haven't seen the game for many years, so I apologise if this
remake is not accurate, but I just based it on memory.

This was developed midway through the Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course,
and represents the knowledge I had of the language at that point (i.e. no OOP).

Current Version: v1.5
  in which I updated the code to work with CodeSkulptor's new integer and float rules
  and also changed the velocity damping factor from 0.9 to 0.7 to make movement more predictable.

Earlier Versions:
  v1.4 (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user9_WqwyV6z7OsvIYq8.py)
  . in which I utilised the new text width functions and adapted the game to run at variable frame rates.

  v1.3 (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user4-LHqyHJCu49j37Rf.py)
  . in which I fixed a bug that allowed barriers without holes to be generated.

  v1.2 (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user4-ltFlPO4h6ZD8LNC.py)
  . in which I added vertical lines to the trench walls and added more comments to the code.

  v1.1 (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user4-FQssuMMrmX8K9tg.py)
  . in which I provided a warning about the flashing effects and allowed them to be turned off,
    and also changed references from Photon Torpedoes to Proton Torpedoes.

  v1.0 (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user4-TUA5Ti3pPicfK3M.py)

I've made the game challenging, but not too hard. I can destroy the Death Star about once every
three attempts, so I think that I pitched it about right, but of course you can edit the code
and shrink the dimensions of your X-Wing, or reduce your velocity if you find it too tough.

Tip 1: remember that X-Wings are wider than they are tall. 
Tip 2: don't forget to fire your proton torpedoes once your distance display reads zero.

May the force be with you all.
